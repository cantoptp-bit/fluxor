OAuth2 scopes define the level of access that an application can request from a user. When a user authorizes an application, they grant permission for the application to access specific resources on their behalf.

## Available scopes

| Scope | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `identify` | Allows access to basic user information including username, discriminator, avatar, and flags. |
| `email` | Allows access to the user's email address. Requires the identify scope. |
| `guilds` | Allows access to the list of guilds the user is a member of. |
| `bot` | Used for bot authorization. Adds a bot to a guild on behalf of the authorizing user. |
