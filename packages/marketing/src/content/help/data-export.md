You can request a complete export of your account data, including all messages and attachment URLs.

## How to request an export

1. Log in at <% app login %>.
2. Open Settings (cogwheel, bottom left).
3. Go to **Privacy Dashboard**.
4. Select the **Data Export** tab.
5. Click **Request Data Export**.

You can request an export once every **7 days**.

## What's included

- All your user account information
- All messages you've sent
- URLs to download any attachments from your messages

## Receiving your export

When ready, you'll receive an email with a download link to a zip file. The link is valid for **7 days**.

## Before you delete anything

The export includes URLs for downloading your attachments, but deleting a message also deletes its attachments. Download what you need before deleting messages or [deleting your account](/help/delete-account). Attachments also expire based on size; see [How attachment expiry works](/help/attachment-expiry).
