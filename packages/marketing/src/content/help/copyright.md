Fluxer respects the intellectual property of every creator and expects the same from the whole community.

## Filing a copyright complaint

Use our report form at <% app report %> and choose the copyright or intellectual property option, or email **dmca@fluxer.app** with the subject line "DMCA Takedown Request." Your notice should include:

- A description of the copyrighted work you believe has been infringed.
- The precise location of the infringing material on Fluxer (message links, channel IDs, etc.).
- A good faith statement that the disputed use is not authorised by you, your agent, or the law, and that the information in the notice is accurate.
- A statement under penalty of perjury that you are the rights holder or authorised to act on their behalf.
- Your contact information (mailing address, telephone number, and/or email).
- Your physical or electronic signature.

Do not file false or malicious reports, submit duplicates, or ask others to report the same content. Repeated violations may lead to account penalties.

## Counter-notices

If you believe content was removed by mistake, send a counter-notice to **dmca@fluxer.app** containing:

- Identification of the removed content and its location before removal (message links, channel IDs, etc.).
- A good faith statement that it was removed because of a mistake or misidentification.
- Your contact information (mailing address, telephone number, and/or email).
- A statement consenting to the jurisdiction of the Federal District Court for your district (or the Northern District of California if outside the US), and that you will accept service of process from the original complainant.
- Your physical or electronic signature.

Counter-notices with missing elements cannot be processed. Once we receive a valid counter-notice, we forward it to the complainant. Unless they file a court action, we may restore the material 10–14 business days later at our discretion.

## Consequences

Repeat copyright or IP infringers may have their accounts terminated, and in serious cases we may take stronger enforcement actions.
