Our [Privacy Policy](/privacy) covers what we collect and how we use it. This article explains how long we keep different kinds of data.

## What we always keep

We keep the information needed to run your account and comply with the law: your username, email address, phone number, and basic usage data. Everything else is optional and you can remove it.

## What you can delete yourself

You can remove anything you've posted while you still have access to the space where you posted it:

- Delete individual messages or attachments directly inside Fluxer.
- Bulk delete via the Privacy Dashboard. See [Requesting data deletion](/help/data-deletion).
- For the full account deletion flow, see [How to delete or disable your account](/help/delete-account).

Deleted content is no longer visible to other users, though cached copies may take a short time to clear. For help deleting specific content, email **privacy@fluxer.app**.

## Retention until account deletion

Most personal information stays for as long as your account is active. Inactive accounts may be deleted after two years.

Account deletion completes after a **14-day** waiting period. During that time you can log in to cancel. After 14 days, we delete identifying information and anonymise the rest. Identifying data in backups can take up to 45 days to clear.

## Specific retention periods

- **Age verification IDs:** Deleted within 60 days after the appeal closes.
- **Backups:** 30–45 days, then deleted.
- **Tax and legal records:** Kept for the period required by law.
- **Contact details after deletion:** 180 days for trust and safety. Up to two years if the account was flagged for Terms of Service violations.
- **Support conversations about data:** Up to five years after the ticket closes, for legal purposes.
- **Shared content:** Content you shared with others may remain visible after your account is deleted, but is no longer linked to you. Delete it before removing your account, or ask privacy@fluxer.app for help.

We keep aggregated or anonymised information (which can no longer identify you) indefinitely to understand platform trends.

## Your rights

Every user can manage their data inside Fluxer or by contacting **privacy@fluxer.app**. EU users have additional rights under the GDPR (access, rectification, erasure, restriction, portability, and objection), which you can exercise through your account or by emailing us.
