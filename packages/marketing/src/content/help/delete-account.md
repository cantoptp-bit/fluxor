You can either disable or delete your account from your account settings.

## How to get there

1. Log in at <% app login %>.
2. Open Settings (cogwheel, bottom left).
3. Go to **Security & Login**.
4. Choose **Delete account** or **Disable account**.

## Deleting your account

Deleting schedules permanent removal in **14 days**. During that period you can cancel by logging in again. After the 14 days, your account and data are permanently removed.

Inactive accounts are automatically deleted after 2 years.

### Messages

Your messages remain on the platform unless you delete them first:

- **Bulk delete**: Use the Privacy Dashboard to delete all messages at once. See [Requesting data deletion](/help/data-deletion).
- **Export first**: Export your data before deleting anything. See [Exporting your account data](/help/data-export).
- **Specific deletion**: Email **privacy@fluxer.app** from your registered address to request deletion of specific data.

You cannot delete your messages after your account is deleted – handle your data first.

## Disabling your account

Disabling logs you out of all devices. Your account stays on the platform but is inaccessible until you log in again.

## At a glance

- **Disable**: Logs you out of all devices. Log in again any time to re-enable.
- **Delete**: Permanent removal after 14 days. Log in within that window to cancel.
