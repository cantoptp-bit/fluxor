Your date of birth can't be edited directly in the app. If it's wrong, our support team can update it for you.

## What you'll need

- A valid government-issued ID
- The correct date of birth
- A short explanation of why it needs to change (for example, a typo during sign-up)

## How to request a change

Email support@fluxer.app from the email address linked to your Fluxer account. Include the correct date of birth, a brief reason, and a clear photo of your ID.

## Things to know

- **One change per account**: For security reasons, we generally allow only one date of birth change.
- **Feature access**: If the new date of birth changes your eligibility for age-restricted features, your access will be updated to match.
- **ID handling**: Any ID you send is handled securely and deleted after verification is complete.
