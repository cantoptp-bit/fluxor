You can delete your messages and other content at any time through the Privacy Dashboard or by contacting our privacy team.

## Delete all messages

1. Log in at <% app login %>.
2. Open Settings (cogwheel, bottom left).
3. Go to **Privacy Dashboard**.
4. Select the **Data Deletion** tab.
5. Click **Delete all my messages**.

Mass-deletion runs in the background and completes as soon as possible relative to the volume of messages you've sent.

## Delete specific data

Email **privacy@fluxer.app** from your account's registered email address with details of what you'd like removed.

## Before you delete

- Deleting a message also deletes its attachments. If you want to keep them, [export your data](/help/data-export) first.
- You cannot delete messages after your account is deleted. Handle your data before initiating [account deletion](/help/delete-account).
- Attachments expire based on size regardless of deletion; see [How attachment expiry works](/help/attachment-expiry).
