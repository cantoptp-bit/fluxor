# Licensing

Fluxer is licensed under the **GNU Affero General Public License v3.0 (AGPLv3)**. See [`LICENSE`](./LICENSE).

AGPLv3 is a strong copyleft licence designed to keep improvements available to the community, including when the software is used over a network.

## Self-hosting: fully unlocked

If you self-host Fluxer on your own hardware, all features are available by default. We don't charge to unlock functionality, remove limits, or increase instance caps for deployments you run yourself.

If Fluxer is useful to you, please consider [donating to support development](https://fluxer.app/donate).

## Commercial licensing

Some organisations can't use AGPLv3 due to policy or compliance requirements, or because they don't want to take on AGPL obligations for private modifications.

In these cases, Fluxer Platform AB can offer Fluxer under a separate commercial licence (sometimes called dual licensing). This is the same software, but the commercial terms remove AGPLv3's copyleft obligations for internal deployments.

Fluxer remains AGPLv3 and publicly available. The only difference is your obligations for private modifications. Under the commercial licence, you may keep internal modifications private rather than being required to publish them solely because you run the modified software.

A core requirement of the commercial licence is internal use only. You may not redistribute a modified version (or your modifications) to third parties under the commercial licence.

If you want to share changes, you can upstream them to this repository under Fluxer's AGPLv3 licence. The commercial licence makes upstreaming optional rather than required, but it doesn't grant permission to distribute modifications under any other licence.

To request a commercial licence, email [support@fluxer.app](mailto:support@fluxer.app) and include your employee count so we can provide an initial estimate. Commercial licences are offered at a custom price point.

## Contributor License Agreement

Code contributions require a signed contributor licence agreement: see [`CLA.md`](./CLA.md). You will be prompted to sign electronically via CLA Assistant when you open your first pull request.

Our CLA is based on the widely used Harmony Individual CLA. It is intended to be clear and fair:

- You keep ownership of your contribution and can still use it elsewhere.
- You grant Fluxer Platform AB the rights needed to distribute your contribution as part of Fluxer, including a patent licence to reduce patent-related risk for users.
- It includes standard warranty and liability disclaimers that protect contributors.

It also includes an outbound licensing clause. If Fluxer Platform AB relicenses your contribution (including commercially), Fluxer Platform AB will continue to license your contribution under the project licence(s) that applied when you contributed. Signing the CLA doesn't remove Fluxer from the community.

## Our FOSS commitment

Fluxer is committed to remaining 100% FOSS for public development and distribution.

The CLA doesn't change that. It ensures Fluxer Platform AB has the legal permission to offer a commercial licence to organisations that need different terms, while keeping the community version open, fully featured, and AGPLv3-licensed.
